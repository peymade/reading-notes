#### Sizes of Images

- Use width and height CSS properties to change the size of an image on a page. 
- Use the float property to change the placement of images on a screen. 
- Use the `display: block` to change an image from inline to block. That gives more flexibility with how it can be aligned. Use the `text-align` property on the containing element, and the `margin: auto` on the actual element, to center it. 
- `background-image: url("")` lets you place a background image on the page.
- `background-repeat` can take lets you repeat the image to fill the space, horizontally (`repeat-x`) vertically (`repeat-y`) or not at all (`no-repeat`).
- `background-position` can be used to move a background image around on the screen
- Use a low contrast background image, or create a screen for the text to sit on
