There are many ways to use markdown. Here are some of my notes on Markdown syntax.

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3

This is an unordered list
* One
* Two
* Three

This is an ordered list
1. One
1. Two
1. Three

For the unordered list, it is helpful to use "1." repeatedly instead of 1. 2. 3. This will make it easier to add elements to the list. 

*Italics*
```*Italics*```

**Bold**
```**Bold**```

***Bold and Italics***
```***Bold and Italics***```

~~strikethrough~~
```~~strikethrough~~```
