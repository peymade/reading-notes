## Markdown Summary

Markdown is a powerful tool for displaying information on GitHub platforms. On this page, I will show a few tools that can be used to style that text.

First things first: Headers. One can use the "#" symbol to specify different sizes for header text. 

# This is an H1
```# <-- One hash mark makes an H1```
## This is an H2
```## <-- Two hash marks make an H2```
### This is an H3
```### <-- Three hash marks make an H3```

There are two types of lists that are common as well. Unordered and ordered lists. Unordered lists can be made with the "\*" or with the "-"

### Unordered list
* One
* Two
* Three

For an ordered list, it is helpful to use "1." repeatedly instead of 1. 2. 3. This will make it easier to add elements to the list. 

### Ordered list
1. One
1. Two
1. Three

### Text Formatting

*Italics*
```*Italics*```

**Bold**
```**Bold**```

***Bold and Italics***
```***Bold and Italics***```

~~strikethrough~~
```~~strikethrough~~```

### Images and Links

To put an image on a page, use this formatting for the Markdown:
```![IMAGE NAME](IMAGE LINK)```
To add a link to a page, use this formatting:
```[LINK TEXT](LINK)```

### Tables

Tables may also be helpful to have. Separate the content with pipes ```|``` and with hyphens ```-``` 

In order to make a table about Pros and Cons, my code would look like this:

```Pros | Cons```
```--------|-----```
```Happiness | Less functionality```
```More time | Harder work```

Pros | Cons
--------|-----
Happiness | Less functionality
More time | Harder work
