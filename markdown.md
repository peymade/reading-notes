There are many ways to use markdown. Here are some of my notes on Markdown syntax.

One can use the "#" symbol to specify different sizes for header text. 

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3

There are two types of lists that are common as well. Unordered and ordered lists. Unordered lists can be made with the "\*" or with the "-"

### Unordered list
* One
* Two
* Three

### Ordered list
1. One
1. Two
1. Three

For the unordered list, it is helpful to use "1." repeatedly instead of 1. 2. 3. This will make it easier to add elements to the list. 

*Italics*
```*Italics*```

**Bold**
```**Bold**```

***Bold and Italics***
```***Bold and Italics***```

~~strikethrough~~
