# The Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is a commitment to a way of thinking that places hard work and determination over talent. 
A few reminders for myself on how to embrace the growth mindset:

1. Recognize when there is an impulse to switch tasks, acknowledge it, and fight it. 
2. Remember that the rewards of hard work are much greater than the instant gratification of avoiding that work.
3. Use criticism as a tool for growth.
