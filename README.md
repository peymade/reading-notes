# Welcome to Reading Notes

Hi there! My name is Peyton. I am a college student with a passion for problem solving, music, and design, and I am starting my journey into the world of coding. 
This website will be a place keep track of the notes I compile during my classes with Code Fellows. These notes will cover subjects such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## The Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is a commitment to a way of thinking that places hard work and determination over talent. 
A few reminders for myself for how to embrace the growth mindset:

1. Recognize when there is an impulse to switch tasks, acknowledge it, and fight it. 
2. Remember that the rewards of hard work are much greater than the instant gratification of avoiding that work
3. Use criticism as a tool for growth
