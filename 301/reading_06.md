## Node.js [Link](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

**node.js?** --> A runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser.

**Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine** --> it takes JavaScript and makes it into something that individual's computers can read and execute. The Chrome V8 engine is not exactly what node is built on, though. Cause node doesn't run in the browser.

**Node is a JavaScript runtime** --> It executes code on the computer, not necessarily on the browser.

**npm** --> A package manager for JavaScript. 
For example, if you wanted to install a package called 'jshint,' you would type `npm install -g jshint`. This would install the package globally, as indicated by the g. 

**My Node Version**: 14.6.1
**My npm Version**: 6.14.12

Using the terminal command `node` then the JS file name, the console logs appear directly in the terminal. 

Using npm and Node in tandem to install and run build tools lets one test code, do code linting, and other helpful tasks. When working with React, it is especially important to have a working knowledge of node and npm. 

Node is event-driven and has non-blocking behavior, making it potentially more efficient. Node is an especially handy choice for things that require updating in real timr. 

Node can also be used as a scripting language, or to write one's own terminal tool. 

## Pair Programming [Link](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

How it works: one person is the driver, and the other is the navigator. The driver is the one typing the code and handling the immediate tech issues, and the navigator is watching, strategizing, and researching. 

**Reasons to Pair Program**

1. Greater Efficiency
   The work goes more quickly when two people work on it at once. The process will take longer when you are doing it, but there is time saved in the later processes of debugging and other time-consuming problems with code that would be less well written. 
2. Collaboration
    Having someone keeping you accountable decreases procrastination, and the other partner can be a great source of knowledge for answering quick questions. 
3. Learning from each other
    People have different ways of approaching code, so the process of collaboration can be an educational one. Partners also have different strengths, which can help the other partner. 
4. Social Skills
    Pair programming requires a lot of constant communication with one's partner, so it is a really good way to improve social skills and get to know peers. 
5. Job readiness
    Pair programming, or situations similar to it, can appear in job interviews. So it is good to get experience prior to those interviews. 
6. Work environment readiness
    Gives Codefellows grads an edge over people who are not familiar with the format.

I have found the collaboration bullet point important- because it is easy for me to get off track when I am working alone, so having a partner makes me get more done.
