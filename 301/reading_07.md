## Summary of Google Article [Link](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

- Work has become more team-focused over the last two decades
- While it may seem that collaboration would slow things down and decrease productivity, for software engineers it increases it
- Google collected data and attempted to find patterns in what makes up a good team. But there weren't factors about the individual team members that were consistent across all productive teams. 
- They found that each group had distinct norms, even if they weren't explicitly stated by the group leaders. 
- A few commonalities were seen between successful groups in further research:
  - People spoke roughly the same amount as other group members. There was equality in air-time
  - Teams who had people who had higher emotional intelligence and who were more responsive to social cues, did better on tasks

**Psychological Safety** is the safety felt in taking risks around other people. It is having trust in those around you, and feeling like you can be yourself. This is the measure that researchers found to be most important to building a good group dynamic.

The http specifies to the browser the type of protocol to use. 
*Polymorphism* is when different nouns can have same verb applied.

### Who is Roy Fielding?

He was one of the first computer scientists to build HTTP specifications. He helped to write web servers that send documents.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

The way the web was designed was not for all machines to talk to all other machines- it was not a primary concern.  

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 
This protocol follows a request-response protocol 
A web browser makes a request and 'gets' the data from the server

**GET** what the browser's main action verb is. It gets information. A machine gets machine-readable info and the browser gets the human readable info. 
**POST** a system adding something to another system
**PATCH** a system doing a partial update of another
**PUT** a system replacing something in another system
