## That Time When Women Stopped Coding [Link](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

In the early days of computing, women were well represented in the computing fields, but in 1984, there was a sharp decline that began in terms of the numbers of women in computer science. 

- During the rise of the personal computer, the machines were marketed towards men. 
- It then became a part of the cultural narrative that computers & tech & masculinity are intertwined. 
- This matters, because when students go on to study computer science, say, at university, there may be an expectation that the students have some base level of knowledge about computers, which the guys have because of their spending more time with computers when they were younger. 

(Thoughts)

A lot of the women in tv shows/movies who are more geeky and interested in tech are written as unemotional, aloof, and generally non-feminine. There is no problem with women not being feminine! But that's just a pattern I observe. One great female-coder example I can think of though, is [Mac](https://veronicamars.fandom.com/wiki/Cindy_Mackenzie) from Veronica Mars :) 

## Diversity in Tech [Link](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

Three takeaways:

- Certain companies that were reflective of the general population on some fronts were completely not reflective of the population by other measures... So a company may have good diversity by one metric, but often not on the whole
- The FAANG companies were lower on the list (filtering by multiple metrics) than I had expected
- Congress has only 20% women and is 80% white? That is wild. I feel like I knew, that, but seeing it visually is interesting. So I suppose that overall, tech companies have better diversity than congress!


## Why Diversity Matters to Your Tech Company [Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they come from the top of an organization! If the leaders are 100% committed to the efforts, it is likely that is will become a part of company cultre.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

For teams that work with creativity and innovation, having people from all sorts of backgrounds brought benefits. Different people saw different ways to solve problems. Diversity helps financial outcomes across the board!

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

A company led by someone with a physical disability may be more aware of the challenges different people could run into when using the product. For example- if you were working on designing the Kinect or Wii, it would be helpful to have people working on it who were aware of the physical limitations of some sub-set of consumers.


## Things I wonder

If getting into comptuers at a young age (particularly with video games) correlates with participation in the tech industry later in life... I wonder what the stats of the game development industry look like in terms of gender & ethnicity, and how many women feel they have a place in online gaming communities. 

I am curious how much the diversity stats for an individual company compare to their leadership team or who the CEO is.
